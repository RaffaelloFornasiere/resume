# Summary

I am a software engineer with practical experience in LLM integration
and AI agent development. I have built AI-powered applications in
healthcare and research contexts, working across the full stack. My
background combines AI/ML knowledge with hands-on development skills to
deliver production-ready solutions.

# Professional Experience

**AI Agent Developer**, Freelance for William Saunders, Alignment
Science Researcher at Anthropic (May 2025 - Present)

- Building a proactive personal assistant that can autonomously initiate
  conversations and manage tasks.

- Implementing tool integrations (e.g. Google APIs), plus custom
  note-taking systems.

- Tech stack: FastAPI, React, Claude API, RAG, event-driven
  architecture, and various third-party APIs.

**Lead Software Engineer - Front-End**, Infiniteloop (October 2022 -
Present)

- Prototyped AI healthcare applications using LLMs, exploring
  feasibility for medical report automation (related to my thesis work).

- Designed, built and maintained user interfaces using Angular, ensuring
  seamless integration with JHipster framework.

- Developed reusable JHipster framework extensions (e.g. an extended
  JHipster Criteria API, a custom Spring Data JPA repository for
  bidirectional relationship synchronization).

- Lead the development of different products.

- Mentored two junior developers and promoted best practices to improve
  code quality.

**Junior Full Stack Developer**, Prodigys Group (July 2021 - September
2022)

- Developed and maintained both front-end and back-end components using
  Angular, Spring Boot, and Django.

- Optimized database performance through SQL query refactors, reducing
  execution times from hours to minutes.

# Education

**Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering**, Politecnico di Milano
(Graduated July 2024)

- Thesis: Exploring the Potential of Lightweight LLMs for Medication and
  Timeline Extraction.

- Developed a web application integrating LLMs for medical information
  extraction, **tested in three Italian hospitals**.

- Published research: “Medical Information Extraction with Large
  Language Models” (ACL 2024).

**Bachelor’s in Electronics Engineering**, Università degli Studi di
Udine (Graduated July 2020)

- Thesis: Optimization of Digital Circuit Propagation Times Using
  Genetic Algorithms.

# Technical Skills

**AI/ML & LLM Integration:**

- Production experience with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude), and
  prompt engineering.

- Experience with local/lightweight models (with llamacpp) for
  privacy-sensitive applications.

- Agent development: Autonomous systems, tool integrations, streaming
  responses and conversational interfaces.

- NLP: Text extraction, information retrieval, medical language
  processing.

- Libraries: LangChain, llamacpp, Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow.

- Academic background in neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, transformers),
  optimization methods.

**Languages:**

- Primary: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java.

- Also experienced with: C++, SQL.

- Others: CSS, HTML.

**Frameworks, Libraries and Tools:**

- Back-end: FastAPI, Django, Spring Boot, JHipster.

- Front-end: React, Vue.js, Angular.

- Others: Docker, Git, Tailwind CSS, Streamlit, Spring Data JPA,
  Postgres/PostgreSQL, SQLite.

# Academic Projects

**Medical Image-Caption Matching with Transformers**

- Reimplemented CLIP model from scratch for medical radiology
  applications using ResNet vision encoder and custom transformer text
  encoder.

- Trained and fine-tuned both models using contrastive learning,
  pre-trained BERT integration, caption preprocessing, and medical
  concept augmentation techniques.

- Developed evaluation methods for assessing image-caption alignment in
  medical domain.

**Online Learning for Dynamic Pricing in E-commerce**

- Exploration work implementing multi-armed bandit algorithms (GP-TS,
  GP-UCB) with social influence modeling to optimize advertising budget
  allocation across product campaigns.

**Deep Learning Projects with CNNs**

- **Species Classification:** Implemented transfer learning with
  VGG16/19 and EfficientNet models, applying data augmentation
  techniques (CutMix, MixUp) and ensemble methods to achieve 86.91%
  accuracy on image classification tasks.

- **Time Series Classification:** Developed CNN-LSTM hybrid
  architectures for sequential data analysis, experimenting with
  preprocessing techniques including normalization and noise
  augmentation to reach 70% classification accuracy.

# Other Experiences

**ML4Good AI Safety Bootcamp**

- Completed EPFL’s iteration of the [ML4Good](https://www.ml4good.org/)
  AI Safety and ML Bootcamp (February 2023).

# Community Involvement

**Volunteer developer for hometown community**

- Built website to publish local competition status with real-time
  updates through Telegram bot.

- Developed web application to emulate Italian TV game show, managing
  multiplayer gameplay across mobile devices.
