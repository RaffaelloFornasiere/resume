# Summary

I am a software engineer with practical experience in LLM integration
and AI agent development. I have built AI-powered applications in
healthcare and research contexts, working across the full stack. My
background combines AI/ML knowledge with hands-on development skills to
deliver production-ready solutions. I recently have been accepted at
LASR Labs and ARENA to transition into technical AI safety work.

# Professional Experience

**LASR Labs Mentee**, LASR Labs (January 2026 – April 2026, upcoming)

- Selected for a 13-week AI safety research program in London.

- Working in small teams with supervisors to produce academic-style
  research on AI safety topics.

**ARENA 7.0 Mentee**, ARENA (January 2026 – February 2026, upcoming)

- Selected participant in a 5-week full-time bootcamp focused on ML
  engineering for technical AI safety.

- Curriculum covering transformers, reinforcement learning, mechanistic
  interpretability, and safety evaluations.

- Awarded 1st prize at ARENA’s interpretability hackathon.

**AI Agent Developer**, Freelance for William Saunders, Alignment
Science Researcher at Anthropic (May 2025 - Present)

- Building an AI conversational assistant, with manageable memory and
  personalizable with many tools and external services.

- The agent has a web interface with chat, text-to-speech and
  speech-to-speech interfaces.

- Tech stack: FastAPI, React, Claude API, RAG, event-driven
  architecture, and various third-party APIs.

**Lead Software Engineer - Front-End**, Infiniteloop (October 2022 -
Present)

- Prototyped AI healthcare applications using LLMs, exploring
  feasibility for medical report automation (related to my thesis work).

- Designed, built and maintained user interfaces using Angular, ensuring
  seamless integration with JHipster framework.

- Developed reusable JHipster framework extensions (e.g. an extended
  JHipster Criteria API, a custom Spring Data JPA repository for
  bidirectional relationship synchronization).

- Lead the development of different products.

- Mentored two junior developers and promoted best practices to improve
  code quality.

**Junior Full Stack Developer**, Prodigys Group (July 2021 - September
2022)

- Developed and maintained both front-end and back-end components using
  Angular, Spring Boot, and Django.

- Optimized database performance through SQL query refactors, reducing
  execution times from hours to minutes.

# Education

**Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering**, Politecnico di Milano
(Graduated July 2024)

# Academic Projects

**Medical Image-Caption Matching with Transformers**

- Reimplemented CLIP model from scratch for medical radiology
  applications using ResNet vision encoder and custom transformer text
  encoder.

- Trained and fine-tuned both models using contrastive learning,
  pre-trained BERT integration, caption preprocessing, and medical
  concept augmentation techniques.

- Developed evaluation methods for assessing image-caption alignment in
  medical domain.

**Online Learning for Dynamic Pricing in E-commerce**

- Exploration work implementing multi-armed bandit algorithms (GP-TS,
  GP-UCB) with social influence modeling to optimize advertising budget
  allocation across product campaigns.

**Deep Learning Projects with CNNs**

- **Species Classification:** Implemented transfer learning with
  VGG16/19 and EfficientNet models, applying data augmentation
  techniques (CutMix, MixUp) and ensemble methods to achieve 86.91%
  accuracy on image classification tasks.

- **Time Series Classification:** Developed CNN-LSTM hybrid
  architectures for sequential data analysis, experimenting with
  preprocessing techniques including normalization and noise
  augmentation to reach 70% classification accuracy.
